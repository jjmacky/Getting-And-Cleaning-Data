- run_analysis.R is the script required in the course project of Coursera's 2014 session of "Getting and Cleaning Data."  The course project uses the Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HARUS) dataset, and asks us to create several "tidy" versions by combining multiple files from the original dataset.

- Tidy_HARUS_Col_Means.txt is the dataset required to be output by Step 5 in the course project directions.

- Tidy_HARUS_Col_Means.csv is the same file as above, but in a csv format, which can be easily viewed using standard spreadsheet software.

- features_info.txt is a useful description of what each of the column names represent. This file was provided by the authors of the original HARUS dataset.

- CodeBook.Rmd is a markdown file that describes how each of the three Tidy_HARUS datasets above was created, their dimensions, structure, and other useful information.

* The following files are not included in the Github repository to save space
******************************************************************************

- Tidy_HARUS_All.txt is a dataset not explicitly requested in the course project instructions. This is an intermediate "tidy" dataset with all columns of the original present. This dataset is useful if other types of analysis is desired with columns other than those containing the mean and standard deviations.

- Tidy_HARUS_All.csv is the same file as above, but in a csv format, which can be easily viewed using standard spreadsheet software.

- Tidy_HARUS_Means_And_stds.txt is a dataset that takes Tidy_HARUS_All and excludes all column names that do not contain "mean" or "std."

- Tidy_HARUS_Means_And_stds.csv is the same file as above, but in a csv format, which can be easily viewed using standard spreadsheet software.
